module: set_platform_fact
short_description: Set facts depending on platform
description:
    - This module is built on-top the M(set_fact) module, and it enables setting of facts using a dictionary that uses platform-matcher strings as
      keys, and the platform-specific vars as values
    - This module checks platform strings from the most to least specific. Use the I(add_match_facts) option to print out platform strings for the
      system you are currently working on.
    - This module allows setting new variables.  Variables are set on a host-by-host basis just like facts discovered by the setup module.
    - These variables will be available to subsequent plays during an ansible-playbook run, but will not be saved across executions even if you use
      a fact cache.
    - Per the standard Ansible variable precedence rules, many other types of variables have a higher priority, so this value may be overridden.
      See U(http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable) for more information.
options:
  key_value:
    description:
      - The C(set_platform_fact) module takes key=platform_value_dict pairs as variables to set
        in the playbook scope.
      - In addition to platform string matchers, the keyword 'default' can be specified. This will be used in case no other match is found.
    default: null
  skip_non_matches:
    description:
      - Skip variables where no match is found, instead of erroring out.
    default: false
  ignore_case:
    description:
      - Whether to ignore case when matching platform strings.
    default: true
  add_match_facts:
    description:
      - Adds a '_platform_strings', and, if applicable, '_platform_match_*' variables to the returned facts.
      - This is useful mainly for debug purposes, but can be used on it's own (without actually adding any other facts).
    default: false
  cacheable:
    description:
      - This boolean indicates if the facts set will also be added to the
        fact cache, if fact caching is enabled.
    type: bool
    default: false
version_added: "2.6"

EXAMPLES = '''
# Example setting host facts using complex arguments
- set_platform_fact:
     one_fact:
       ubuntu-18.04: something
       ubuntu-bionic: something other
       ubuntu-18: something else again
       debian: true
       redhat: false
       default: 0

# As of 1.8, Ansible will convert boolean strings ('true', 'false', 'yes', 'no')
# to proper boolean values when using the key=value syntax, however it is still
# recommended that booleans be set using the complex argument style:
- set_platform_fact:
    one_fact:
      debian: true
      redhat: false
